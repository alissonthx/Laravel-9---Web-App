# Laravel 9 Web App
<h2>Application Proposal</h2>
<p>Our client Jose Gustavo, passionate about football and technology, wants to have a
application that simulates football championships in your neighborhood, called Meu
Championship.</p>
<p>To do this, consider an eliminatory system that starts in the quarter-finals:</p>
<ul>
<li>eight teams participate in the championship;</li>
<li>the loser of each game is eliminated from the championship;</li>
<li>in the first phase (quarter-finals) four games are drawn, with each
team plays only once;</li>
<li>in the second phase (semi-finals) two games are drawn, with each team
play only once;</li>
<li>the losers of the semi-finals compete for 3rd place;</li>
<li>the final is played by the winners of the semi-finals, defining 1st and 2nd place in the
championship;</li>
<li>In the event of a tie, the team with the highest score will be considered the winner.
(accumulated since the beginning of the championship):</li>
<ul>
<li>for each goal scored, the team receives 1 point;</li>
<li>for every goal conceded, the team loses 1 point;</li>
</ul>
<li>in case of a new tie, consider the team that was registered as the winner
first in the championship;</li>
<li>the score for each game can be generated randomly by the back-end or by
a routine in Python, as detailed in the following topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game score</h2>
<p>The score for each game can be generated by a Python routine, with the code
presented below.<p>

``` python
import random
print(random.randrange(0, 8, 1))
print(random.randrange(0, 8, 1))
# Example output:
#0
# two
```
<p>The back-end must execute the above script, capture its output and use it as
result of each match.<p>
